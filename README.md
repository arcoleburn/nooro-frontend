# Hey there, Nooro! 

This is my frontend repo for the fullstack take home test. 

## Let's get it Running 

First, get the backend up and running, and make sure its running on port `3000`. 

After you've done that, once you've `npm i`, just `npm run dev` and you should be good to go! 

Looking forward to chatting! :sunglasses:
